These are python versions of the calculations described in:

**Practical Astronomy with Your Calculator, Second Edition**

Author: **Peter Duffett-Smith**

Published: **1982**

ISBN: **0 521 28411 2**

This book was bought for me on a visit to Jodrell Bank near Manchester (probably 1983/84) - had played around with the calculations mainly on spreadsheets before, but recently found the book again and decided to see how the calculations stack up now - there is an element of simplication here - these were designed to be worked out by hand with a scientific calculator - I know that there are various libraries already available, but this is good python practice for me ;)

**NOTE:** This code is not exhaustive - these are the various routines that were needed for what I wanted to code - mainly around calculating sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset
